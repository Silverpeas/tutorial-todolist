This project is an example of how to make a Silverpeas Component or, in another term, an 
application embedded in Silverpeas. Like any other Silverpeas components, it relies upon 
Silverpeas Core.

It is used as a support in the tutorial on how to develop new applications in the Silverpeas 
Collaborative Portal.
